# Overview

For my exploration in learning the Java language, I created multiple programs where I could apply my learning. Most of these programs were just to demonstrate the Java syntax and do not serve any sort of purpose.  In the folder titled learning, I have different sub-folders of some of the topics I explored, the programs in these folders don't have any sort of use except for demonstrating syntax. In the "VariablesAndListsWithLoops" folder I demonstrated the use of variables and lists, as well as some use of loops (mainly to display a list). In the "LogicLoop" folder I demonstrated the use of using logic statements (ex: if, else, switch) and the use of while loops. In the folder "JavaCollectionFramework" I demonstrated using resources in the Java framework through importing and using an Arraylist. In the folder "MethodsAndClasses", I demonstrated the use of multiple classes, methods, abstraction, get and set functions, and inheritance. So after learning all of the basics of Java, I then applied my learning which is shown in the "LearningApplication" folder. In this folder, I demonstrated my learning through making a basic game run through the console with a basic user interface and a game board shown as a grid. In this game, there is a player, villain, and treasure. The goal of the game is for the player to get the hidden treasure without running into the villain. This is done through many classes including a collision detection class as well as an interface class. I found this language to be very similar to the first coding language that I learned, C#, so it was quite easy to learn once I realized some of the small differences in syntax.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* java version 18.0.1.1

# Useful Websites

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

# Future Work
For the learning application program:
* More effective ways to make villains so that I can make more than one to increase the difficulty
* Logic where if the villain and player swap places it leads to a game over
* More organization in how to program functions (applying further encapsulation)
